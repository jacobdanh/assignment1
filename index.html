	 <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>

<p>The World Wide Web is the interconnected network of devices ranging from mobile phones, computers, laptops etc. The Web is a system accessed through the Internet for displaying audio, texts and graphics. The web works like this, for example, if you were to ever search something into google the request goes into a computing system called DMS (domain name servers). This basically is a system which identifies the names and IP addresses so that whatever you have typed into google, it will be able to translate to a specific number corresponding to the right website. To view these websites, the role of a web server is very important. Web servers process incoming network requests using HTTP and many other protocols to respond back to the client’s requests. This is done so that the web servers are able to store, process and deliver the correct web pages to clients.</p>

<p>A web browser is a software program which allows a client to locate and access different web pages. These browsers like google, safari, firefox etc translate web pages using HTTP and other protocols from codes to readable content for us clients.</p>

<h2>Difference between The World Wide Web & Internet</h2>

<p>The difference between the World Wide Web compared to the internet is that the web is a collection of information which is accessed using the internet. The internet is a massive networking infrastructure which connects millions of computers together globally allowing for our networking systems to go “online”. With the internet, access to almost any information, and communication with anyone else in the world is possible. Once the systems go online the web is able to be accessed globally, allowing people to share knowledge and opinions.</p>

<h2>What is the Intranet?</h2>

<p>An intranet is a computer network created for sharing information, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services. However, it is only shared amongst an organization excluding other external public use.

The difference between the internet and the intranet is that an intranet includes multiple connections to the outside Internet limited to being an interconnected network in a company or an organisation. While the internet is a network accessible to everyone in the public for individual use.</p>

<h2>What is an internet protocol?</h2>

<p>The Internet Protocol is the principal communications protocol system taken into a place for carrying out datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking and essentially establishes the Internet. Basically is a set of rules applied to the format of data sent over any network.

File transfer pool, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Transmission Control Protocol are all different protocols which play their own specific part and functions within a networking computing system.

TCP is the communication between computer and network which has the four main layers whereas FTP is the client-server protocol which is the communication between computer to computer for transferring the files.

The basic point that distinguishes HTTP and FTP is that FTP is used to upload or download files between client and server. While HTTP provides a web page from a web server to a web browser. 

There would be no web pages without HTTP and no internet without TCP and no downloading or uploading without FTP.</p>
